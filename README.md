# piranha-cms

[No longer maintained]

PiranhaCMS with maintained pages and components to easily create sites for personal use. It is built to purposefully enable me to make web pages through the PiranhaCMS manager while extending the available pages and components as needed.

Pull requests for friendly components or page layouts etc., are very welcome!
