# devantler-cms
PiranhaCMS with maintained pages and components to easily create sites for personal use. It is built to purposefully enable me to build webpages through the PiranhaCMS manager, while being able to extend the available pages and components as needed.

Pull requests for nice components or page layouts etc are very welcome!
